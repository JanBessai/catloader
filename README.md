# catloader
Shows pictures from Wikimedia.

## Usage
```
python catloader.py [Some Category]
```
where the optional parameter `[Some Category]` is `Cats` by default and selects the category of pictures to show.

## Requirements
Python 3, Gtk 3.

## Notice
I do not know why I wrote/like this program. There was a similar program as an old demo for (CL)S.

If you are a language designer, this might be a nice benchmark.
